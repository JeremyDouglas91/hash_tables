Student #: DPLJER001

The report PDF in the root directory details the entire assigment and contains all test results and graphs, as well as screen shots of the Voter Search Application GUI.

Raw test results are contained in .txt files in doc/testResults/...

The GUI can be launched, tests can be re-run, and the graphs and javadocs can be re-generated from the root directory with the following commands:

1. Launching the Voter Search Applicaiton GUI: $make run_gui

2. Re-running the complexity tests: $make run_tests

3. Re-generating graphs: $make graph

4. Re-generating javadocs: $ make javadoc

Thanks, 
Jeremy
