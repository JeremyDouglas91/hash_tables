The hastable data structure I chose to analyse utilized an AVL tree to resolve collisions:

If we compare the time complexity of the search algorithm used by the data structure above (using the AVL tree to manage collisions), to a hash table data structure which makes use of linear probing over different data set sizes, we get the followig best, average and worst case plots:
